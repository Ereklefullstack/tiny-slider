# Tiny Slider

A basic image slider implementation using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This slider cycles through a series of images every 3 seconds.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the simple JavaScript slider on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need a modern web browser to view and test the slider.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Replace the image sources in the `index.html` file with your own images.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the slider.

## Usage

To add more images to the slider, simply add more `<img>` elements inside the `<div class="slider">` element in the `index.html` file. Make sure to update the `src` attribute with the correct image source and provide a descriptive `alt` attribute for each image.

Example:

```html
<img src="image4.jpg" class="slide" alt="Image 4">
